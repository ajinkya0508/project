							<h2>Our Story</h2>
						</div>

						<p>
							Amidst the pandemic, Klaus Oegerli, a Swiss tourism industry
							veteran was deeply concerned that many friends in his network
							were out of work, while the need for information soared. Under
							what conditions can I go where? Expertise was sought but
							everybody wanted it for free.<br> <br> Klaus gave this
							problem some thought and decided to launch a consumer to consumer
							platform, offering paid video consultation by all kinds of travel
							experts(agents, influencers or affluent and experienced
							travellers and others alike). &nbsp;<br> <br> This idea
							was greeted with mixed reactions by his industry friends. The
							reactions went from “you cannot cut out the middleman, aka the
							commission-based paid travel agent”, “travellers will never pay
							for such a service”. And then there were the instant supporters
							of the idea, and Marc Geissbühler, former VP of Switzerland’s
							largest tour operator Hotelplan who was so convinced of the idea
							that he became an investor and co-founder of
							Travel(Switzerland) AG. A company that was incorporated in
							August 2021. The decision was taken that the marketplace would be
							first rolled out in India, due to the sheer market size and
							competitiveness of the market. Or as Klaus says - “Scalability is
							key; if it survives India, it survives everywhere".&nbsp;<br>
